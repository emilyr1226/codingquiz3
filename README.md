Mini-Max Sum: 
Time complexity: O(n)
Storage Complexity: O(n)

HackerrankInString: 
I was not able to write correct code for this. My plan was trying to see if each character in the string was the same as the last one. If it was, then I planned on not printing that character. Once it iterated through the whole string, I using the String contains() function to see if the outputted word spelled out "hackerrank". If it did, it was to return "YES". If it did not, it was to return "NO". My base case for this function was if the length of the code was less than 10 since hackerrank is 10 letters.
For my code: 
Time complexity: O(n)
Storage complexity: Constant
